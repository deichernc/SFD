Straight Five Design card image repo

The image files contained herein are print-ready front card art (full bleed, 300dpi).

Standard loadout (SL) cards are intended for tarot-sized printing. (70mm x 121mm, 2.75" x 4.75")
All others are intended for standard US-size poker cards (63.5mm x 88.9mm, 2.5" x 3.5")
I use https://www.makeplayingcards.com/ for my card-printing needs, but these will work fine as is for
any card service I've come across.

Use as you wish - these are all either older designs, or just random ideas. No attribution necessary.
